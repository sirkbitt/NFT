# NFT

This is an example created from Alchemy's tutorial "How to create an NFT".
But there are some differences.
My example uses a JSON file instead of a .env one, because (I still don't know why) Hardhat returns an error reading .env file (dman!). But I solved this issue.
Furthermore, I missed to let you all see my private key(s) and my seed(s) (were you thinking about it, I know it! XD).
The other parts are almost the same you can find in this page https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/tutorials/how-to-create-an-nft.
Please, be sure that you've correctly installed all dependencies, included Hardhat (very useful!), Ethersproject and Openzeppelin.
You can read an useful "copy" of Alchemy's tutorial at this Openzeppelin's page https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/connecting-to-public-test-networks. It can be very useful to understand how to connect to public network(s) (like Ropsten, as this project does).
Thanks to Alchemy and its very funny example.

Enjoy it and let's create some funny stuffs ;)
